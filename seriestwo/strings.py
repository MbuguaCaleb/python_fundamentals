# ##I can print the index of each string in python
# print(course2[0])

# ##We can also use a negative index
# ##This will give me the characters from the end
# print(course2[-1])

# ##WE CAN AS WELL RETURN A RANGE OF CHARACTERS
# print(course2[0:3])

# ##if we do not supply the end index python returns
# # all characters to the end of the string
# print(course2[0:])

# print(course2[5:])

# ##If i do not include a start index python will include o by default
# print(course[:7])

# ##WITH PYTHON STRINGS ITS JUST LIKE WHAT I DO WITH AN ARRAY

# print(course[:])

# ##returns entire copy of the string
# another = course[:]

# print(another)
